    "- accessible only within the class where they are declared\n",
    "- restricts direct access from outside the class, enforcing encapsulation\n",
    "- Use of getter and setter methods\n",
    "- higher level of security and making the class more robust against unauthorized modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Identify a scenario when you would use the private vs. public access controllers that isn't the one given in the scenario above\n",
    "**Private**\n",
    "-  Sensitive information such as the account balance, customer identification numbers, and transaction history should be declared as private\n",

Create a Book class that represents the following attributes about a book: title, author, date published, person holding the book and make sure that the objects are using a POJO, the proper getters and setters and are secure from any other modifications that the program makes later to the objects\n"
