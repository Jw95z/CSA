    "This question involves reasoning about one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays of integers. You will write three static methods, all of which are in a single enclosing class, named DiverseArray (not shown). The first method returns the sum of the values of a one-dimensional array; the second method returns an array that represents the sums of the rows of a two-dimensional array; and the third method analyzes row sums.       \n",

    "This FRQ wasn't too tough because I've dealt with similar questions before. Part A was easy; I just did that same code last week. For parts B and C, I knew I'd need two loops, one inside the other, to check everything. But using nested loops isn't great for big problems because it can get slow (it's O(n^2) complexity). Still, I reckon the college board will give me full marks because there's not really a better way to do it."
