    "Assume that the classes listed in the Java Quick Reference have been imported where appropriate.\n",

    "\n",
    "In writing solutions for each question, you may use any of the accessible methods that are listed in classes defined in that question. Writing significant amounts of code that can be replaced by a call to one of these methods will not receive full credit.\n",

    "Consider a guessing game in which a player tries to guess a hidden word. The hidden word contains only capital letters and has a length known to the player. A guess contains only capital letters and has the same length as the hidden word.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a guess is made, the player is given a hint that is based on a comparison between the hidden word and the guess. Each position in the hint contains a character that corresponds to the letter in the same position in the guess. The following rules determine the characters that appear in the hint.\n",

    "\n",
    "![](./images/frq6.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The HiddenWord class will be used to represent the hidden word in the game. The hidden word is passed to the constructor. The class contains a method, getHint, that takes a guess and produces a hint.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose the variable puzzle is declared as follows.\n",
