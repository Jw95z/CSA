## Bullet Point
- I was a hard working student in last year. I spend a lot of time on doing CS assignment. I sometimes spend whole night to finish my project. I remember when Mr.Mortensen gave me a 3.3 out of 3 in the class for being a most hard working student in the class. 
- When I first came here, I usually didn't talk with others because I know my English skills were poor. However, I improved my personal communication skills by meeting my friend Finn. 
- Before attending computer science class, I didn't know about what html and javascript are, but I became familiar with those programming language by keeping making a website and searching the concepts on Youtube. 
- I recently made code block that can actually run code in the website. It looks like a code cell but it actually the textarea, and I put some style to look like code cell. I used API to run the code, and put additional textarea for the response. 
- I made a login system by using API. I used localStorage to store the username to identify which user was login. And if user tries to watch or send the data to the database, I made the code to pull the username from localStorage to send requests to API. 
- I also work for the chess game by using Javascript canvas. First I defined the tile as x and y. Therefore, when users click the tile, x = 0 to 80 will be the one tile. Besides, if the user have a first click for choosing the piece, the second click will be about moving the piece. And all thing I did next is put conditions for each conditions. For example, if user clicks bishop, second click must be diagonal. Also, I made castle and pawn changing to queen when it reaches to the end. 
- Registration page: first pull all the username from the user database by using API. Then if user register with same username, execute the code "error()" to make sure the username is exist. If there is no same username, send it to the database and store the username in localstorage so that user is login.
