## My Score
![img](./images/2015mcq.png)

Unfortunately, out of 39 questions, I got one wrong. I thought it was too much of a waste, so I thought I should carefully check what I got wrong and work hard to get all the questions right next time. 
According to the time shown on the College Board site, the test took me more than some days to finish. In the actual test, we’ll only have an hour and a half, so I’ll need to cut that down. I’m not very concerned about it, though, since the majority of that extra time spent was either helping with a group/class task of some sort for a group member or listening to what someone had to say. The reason the time concerns me isn’t because I don’t think I could finish the test in an hour and a half, but because the fact that so much time was spent on outside distractions throughout the process means I didn’t get a solid measurement of my actual performance on a true AP MC of this nature.


## What I got wrong
Here are some problems that I got wrong by applying and reinforcing previous knowledge, with particular emphasis on problems that I found challenging in terms of execution. In a couple cases, I relearned information that I had forgotten about by taking on the problem.
### Q10 Student interface, Athlete and TennisPlayer Class

Time Spent --> 0:59     

At this time, I was not familiar with the definitions of interface and class, so I got this question wrong. I was also confused about the difference between "extends" and "implements". I should know that an object belonging to a subclass can be referred to by a variable of the superclass type. Specifically, TennisPlayer is a subclass of Athlete, and an object of type TennisPlayer can be referenced by a variable of type Athlete. Now, I know these terms correctly, so in future, when I face same problem, I can easily solve this kind of question. 

## Overall Reflection
### Glow
- These time, actually I think I got a high score because of more time. I was lazy at winter break, so solving 10 question on mcq was my daily task during the break. 
- When I have a question on mcq, I write the code in jupyter notebook and actually run it in order to identify whether I am right or wrong
- I think I showed really strong understanding of class method behaviors with polymorphism
- I have no confusion on java coding algorithms but still don't know some java terms perfectly
