## Two Trimester focus planning
### Data Capture
Lat night, we were able to present about stock presentation to the audience. Artificial intelligence was coded by combining machine learning and LSTM with an algorithm that continues to determine how stocks will rise in the next two months. Basically, I was focusing on user profile and transaction to store user profile and show up datas in the frontend.

### Feedback
After the N@M, I think I should more focus on the frontend styling. In the next trimester, I've been contemplating delving into the realm of animation creation, envisioning a project where I embark on the ambitious task of developing an animated sequence. Rather than merely focusing on the creative process, I aim to incorporate innovative technological solutions to enhance the project's frontend design. One of my key ideas involves implementing a system that meticulously saves each frame of the animation into a comprehensive database. Then I will create an animation on website by uploading each frame.  I had another idea for next semester: beefing up security with two-factor authentication (2FA). Basically, it's adding extra layers of protection when you log in to something. One way is by sending a code to your phone through text, and the other is using Google Authenticator, which generates unique codes. By doing both, I wanted to make sure that people's accounts and info stay safe from hackers.

## Our team's presentation
### Reflection

Last night, when my team was presenting, I kept watching Adi's presentation from behind and kept watching to see how people's reacts to our projects. All of the feedbacks was kind of useful for me, clarifying my goal for next trimester. We have started to look into this and if we find that it is way easier than our code in LSTM and more versatile we might consider switching to it.

### Something interesting for Computer science at N@M
I saw my last trimester group project and saw they're doing the project of quiz game. The background and design were similar to the Pokemon game, which gave it a sense of familiarity.

### Other things I watched at N@M
Exploring classes outside of CompSci, I really enjoyed the photography and ceramics presentations. I especially liked a ceramics project that featured a large airplane and a light-up display that was made to look like an airport runway which I thought was awesome. Some of the images of nature in the photography class were also nice to look at, I believe that the students captured these natural settings in a cool way.
