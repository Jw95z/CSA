    - Easy way to show my code and understand code
- Markdown
    - Simple way to blog

## Comands I used in shell
### wsl
- starts the windows linux envoriment
### cd
- cd stands for change directory and allows you to go into folders
### code
- Opens a VSCODE window with that file/folder
### mkdir
- makes a folder
## Where are my files stored?
### Inside the vscode folder
- created with mkdir
- Finn:~/vscode
## Local vs Github.io
### Local Host:
- meant for experimentation, to test your code before posting it
### Github Pages:
- meant to show your work in a website on the world wide web
